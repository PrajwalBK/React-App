# React-App
This full-stack CRUD app uses React for the frontend, Express.js as middleware, and MongoDB Compass for database management. It enables efficient Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The Express.js backend connects via Mongoose ODM, while React and Axios ensure a smooth, responsive UI.
